# 🎓 AI Answer Evaluation System  
### Multimodal Human-Like Automated Grading using NLP & Whisper

---

## 🚀 Overview

The **AI Answer Evaluation System** is a multimodal intelligent grading platform that evaluates both **text and spoken student answers** using advanced Natural Language Processing techniques.

Unlike traditional keyword-based grading systems, this project uses:

- 🧠 Concept extraction
- 📊 Semantic similarity (Sentence-BERT)
- 🎙️ Speech-to-text conversion (OpenAI Whisper)
- 📝 Human-style feedback generation

This system mimics how a **real examiner evaluates answers**, providing meaningful scores and structured feedback.
